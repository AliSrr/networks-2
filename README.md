# KYVE - Testnets

This repository contains the `genesis.json` files for all KYVE testnets.

The current testnet is [Europa `europa-1`](/europa-1).

[Korellia `korellia`](/korellia) is a deprecated testnet run from Apr. 4th 2022, to TBD. This network was used to run Mission Korellia, our incentivised testnet program.
